<h3>Revision History</h3>

<ul>
<li>Redwine: Fixed a lot of bugs to make it compliant with PHP 5.6 and suitable for Kliqqi v3.0, as it was breaking. Also removed a lot of unnecessary queries to the misc_table.
It is very important to note that this module needs rewriting, as cleaning it up proved to be very painful.</li>
