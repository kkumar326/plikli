<h2>Karma Module</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Karma module recalculates user karma scores when common actions are performed, such as when a user submits an article, leaves a comment, or performs a voting action. Karma scores are a good indicator of how active an account is on a Kliqqi website, and Kliqqi CMS makes use of karma scores when displaying the "Top Users" page.</p>

	<li>The code, as is, updates twice the user_karma in the users table upon up-voting a story.
	<li>Does nothing when downvoting a story.</li>
	<li>If a user repeatedly votes a story up and down, they accumulate karma on up-voting and is not offset by the downvoting. Therefore, the "Vote on an article is removed" value must always be set as a negative value equal to what is set in "Voted on an article"</li>
